               <p> Quimper is a town in the department of Finistere in the western french region of Brittany.  I spent 8 months here as a Teaching Assistant.It was my first time out of India. It was quite an overwhelming experience. My intial impression was that this place is a ghost town.Where were all the people?, where were they hiding? As time went on I came to call Quimper my second home. Mostly because I made some friends.</p>
               I had two roommates: Lisa, From Bamburg, Germany and Daniel, From Guayaquil, Ecuador.
               I spent time with them sometimes during the weekend. I also had great colleagues (Yves,Marine, Pascale, Giselle and Brigitte). I spent Christmas with Yves family in Pluvigner and New Year's at Marine's in Combrit.
               There were other assistants like me working at other schools in the city.
               Eoin was Irish and worked at a near-by school. We would banter when we would meet for some drinks. Oscar and Karina were from Spain and would usually hang out with Daniel because they shared the same language: Spanish. Tom was from Canada and wouldn't stop talking about something or the other. But he's cool. 
               We later met assistants from Private schools :Roxana (Romania), Getter(Estonia), Wenkai & Fang(China), Alexandre (France), Laura & Souad (Spain). Overall, I had an unforgettable experience travelling the region with my friends. However, the most important people from Quimper for me were Walter and Antoinette. They welcomed me into their home even thought I tresspassed into their property. I now spend my vacations in Quimper with them.

             <a name="marseille">  <h1>Marseille</h1></a>
            </div>

               <p> I always heard stories about Marseille being a dangerous town. Usually news stories are centered around drug related gang violence. Moreover, when I first landed in France, I heard there was an acid attack at the station. All this did not deter me from going because my friend Alok from Bangalore who is now working Marseille was willing to let me crash at his place. I stayed for about a week during my first visit in Feb 2018. I went back recently in December 2018 and early January. I spent a little over 3 weeks alone in an appartment while my friend was on a vacation in India. So, I got to pretty much explore the whole city. </p>
               <p>There's tons of places to go for a hike. The calanques are not too far away and accessible by bus. The food joints are open late at night and are cheap. I love this place called Pizza Charly in the Noailles Quarter. Anyway, I spent most of time walking near vieux port or hiking at one of the calanques. Marseille also has these tea bars where hot lemon-mint tea is served. That sort of reminded me of Bangalore and Johnson market. There seems to be a strong mahgrebien presence in the city. Which is cool because coucous is really cheap and copious.   </p>

              <a name="lyon">  <h1>Lyon</h1></a>

               <p> Given that Lyon was sort of in the proximity of Marseille. I decided to go there. But given that I didn't have too much money and was travelling on a very tight budget, I decided to ask in a favour. I called my colleague Brigitte, who grew up in Lyon , to hook me up with her friend. And thus I came to meet Odile.</p>
               <p> Odile is retired , she used to work for the school adminstration. She now does voluteer work to help young immigrants from Africa deal with their administrative problems. I met some of the teens she worked with .  They were great, they cooked up something for dinner while singing songs from their country. I thought the city of Lyon was beautiful with the river soane and rhone running through the city. The steep climb up the pente every evening on the way to Croix-Rousse. The old quarter and the suprisingly dazzling artwork at Fourviere. I spent about 3 days here. I returned recently . However Odile was quite sick. She had just undergone an operation. Anyway, we managed to go out for diner and a lecture at Villeurbaine. Which reminds me that I haven't checked in with her and asked how she was doing since I left.
