               <p> I don't remember why I picked up a Murakami book. Probably because I heard my friends at the office talking about it. Murakami might be Japanese by birth, but his soul is somewhere in the west. His work is replete with references to Jazz and Classical music .When I read 'The Hard boiled Wonderland And The End Of The World' for the first time, I was blown away. Never have I been so immersed in a book . The experiences of the narrator was so relatable. I went on to read his other books like 'Kafka on the shore' and 'The wind-up bird chronicles'. All of them were equally good. Murakami tends to use some kind of dual narrative in his novels. One taking place in the real world and the other in another dimension. </p>

               <p> I didn't know what 'Watchmen' or who Alan moore was before I borrowed the book from my friend. Alan Moore is not your typical comic book writer. He's not simply writing stories. There's deep symbolic meaning and fine attention to detail in Moore's work. Watchmen was a very complex book, even rivaling traditional novels in terms of complexity. Alan Moore's other work such as 'From Hell', 'V for Vendetta ' and ' The swamp thing' are equally complex and profound. When I read Alan Moore, I'm always intrigued by where the story is going and I'm always looking for clues in the panels. Moore really excels at using the comic as a medium for telling stories that are intricate and work on several different levels.

               <p> Neil Gaiman is mostly know for his Sandman Series. However, he's transcended the narrow confines of comics and crossed over to writing novels and even TV shows(Doctor Who). Neil Gaiman seemlessly blends fantasy and fiction. The Sandman series is now a classic, but Gaiman has a lot of forgetten and unnoticed gems in his bibliography. Coralie, American Gods, and Neverwhere were the first books of Gaiman's that I had read. American gods was such a great book that it stayed with me long after . I even read it for a second time. All in all gaiman's has provided me with a sense of entertainement and food for thought while immersing me and other readers in mythology and fantasy with a lot of humour.
