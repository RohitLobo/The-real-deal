<p>Have you thought of the role that chance has played in your life? For example, you end up at party you don’t want to go to and you randomly meet your future girlfriend. Or the cops fine you for drunk driving because you just happened to take a wrong turn. All of life is probably composed of chance encounters. Some are good , some are bad. Our hero Fumiste. had one such chance encounter. <br></p>



<p>Fumiste found himself on a new assignment in the region of <a style="background-color: #ffffa0;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_(administrative_region)">Brittany, France.</a> Having come from a country with tropical climate, he clearly underestimated the winter. As a result, he decided to go to the nearest Decathlon store to buy undergarments in order to keep himself warm. However, what seemed on Google maps to be a simple trip to the store turned out to be something else entirely.</p>

<h2>Lost In The Woods</h2>



<p>One would assume that the path to a store would consist of a footpath clearly marked with signboards. Fumiste couldn’t find any of these. Instead he had to walk through the woods. To make things worse, several paths zig-zagged and weaved in and out of each other. &nbsp;Unfamiliar surroundings and the unreliability of Google contributed to the feeling of isolation. Therefore, Fumiste felt lost and had to rely on his own instincts to make it out. </p>



<h2>Finally , found a way out!</h2>



<p>After wandering around for about half an hour in the wilderness, Fumiste found a way out of the woods. The exit lead to a small suburban area. After asking a local resident for direction, he finally found himself at the Decathlon store where he bought some winter clothing. </p>

<h2>Lost in the forest again<br></h2>



<p>However, since buses in this part of town were rare, Fumiste had to walk back through the forest. Little did he know how screwed he was because the sun sets early in winter in this part of the world. The sun disappeared behind the trees and darkness set in. Fumiste started panicking and started sprinting in the hope of eventually coming across some familiar path or exit. But he had no luck and no way out of the forest. Groping in the darkness he came across a wall. Fumiste hesitated because he did not want trespass private property . What if the owner thinks he’s a burglar and shoots him. Nevermind, he would die anyway ,stranded in the wilderness. So, he took a deep breath and jumped the wall.</p>



<h2>I was lost, but now I’m found</h2>

<p style="text-align:left">Fumiste had landed in someone’s front yard. He saw a door-sized window that gave onto a dinner room/kitchen. The old couple on the other side of the door looked aghast at the stranger. Fumiste decided not to display guilty by making a run for it. So he waved to them. He approached the door, apologized and asked them for directions back home. Before he left though he asked for a glass of water. Seeing that the stranger was famished and tired, the old couple invited him inside to have a sandwich. After conversing for a while, they asked Fumiste to stay for dinner. He met their family at dinner and they drove him back home that evening. From that day on Fumiste had become a permanent fixture at their home. Fumiste had found a second home in another country. All’s well that ends well. </p>
